# Intermediate Javascript Assessments

### Without using Google answer the following:

1. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?
Map takes a certain function and enacts it on a particular array to return completely new values in a new array. Filter takes an array and returns elements of an existing array based on certain disqualifiers or qualifiers.
2. Why would you use object destructuring?

Object destructuring is a good idea when trying to pull certain information out of objects or arrays more easily. Instead of doing tedious dot notation many levels deep, we can destructure a certain attribute of an object an assign it to a variable so we can call on it more easily.


3. What is the difference between var, let, and const?
Var and Let are both able to be changed by assigning them new values. Const cannot be reassigned a new value further down once defined. Let is meant to be used locally within functions, while var and const can be used both locally and globably.


4. Why is testing important?

Testing is important because it allows us to analyze our code by individual function, thus helping us to identify errors earlier and with more precision. This is better than building many lines of code and having multiple bugs written in the code without knowing until running the function.

5. What is a higher order function?

A higher order function is a function that either takes in a function as a variable, or returns a function.

6. What is the difference between a class and an object?

An object is a data set that can have many attributes and values of attributes. A class is a blueprint for how to create these objects.

7. What did you learn during the group project this week? Please include any additional feedback you may have.

Testing is important.

### HTML/CSS Review questions: First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. How do you link a CSS file to your HTML page?

In the header section, with a link tag rel= stylesheet.

2. What is the difference between a div and a span?
A div compartmentalizes a block of code to be acted upon as a unit. A span is an action or design element that is supposed to affect one or multiple divs.

3. What is a CSS class? When should you use an id instead of a class?
A CSS class is an identifier that allows us to act on a particular group of code by referencing its common class. An id is good for identifying a single element, where a class is useful for identifying more than one.

4. Name 4 semantic HTML tags. <p><ul><div><h1>

5. What are three options for creating responsive design?
Flexboxes, hoveron, onclick.

### Stretch: The following questions are potential interview questions. First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. What is front end development? Can you identify any tools/skills that are uniquely required of front end developers?
Front end is highly involved with user experience. This is everything from the design and layout of a web page/application, to the simple functions created and navigation that is carried out by interacting with the page. Front end developers must be good with javascript, and many times must be very skilled with CSS and HTML.


2. What is block scope in JavaScript?

Block scope is a limitation on the usability of variables, as they are defined. A variable defined within a block will not be able to be accessed outside that function it is defined in.

3. How would you explain the idea of "inheritance" in object oriented programming?
Inheritance is creating a new class, and furthermore, potentially an object from a parent class. This object will have all the attributes as values as defined in the parent's constructor, along with any others that are defined locally within the child class.
